# Predicting Invasive Ductal Carcinoma
 
In order to automate the diagnosis of cancerous tissue, this work suggests a deep learning-based IDC classification model that combines ResNet- 50 with FastAI. To enhance performance, the model is trained using histopathology images and incorporates data augmentation, class imbalance handling, and probability landscape analysis. Techniques like resampling and weighted loss functions are used to address class imbalance and guarantee higher recall for IDC-positive cases.
